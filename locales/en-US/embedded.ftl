embedded-pitch-heading = Why Rust?

embedded-pitch-analysis-alt = A microscope
embedded-pitch-analysis-heading = Powerful static analysis
embedded-pitch-analysis-description =
        Enforce pin and peripheral configuration at compile time. Guarantee that resources won’t be used by unintended parts of your application.

embedded-pitch-memory-alt = A RAM stick
embedded-pitch-memory-heading = Flexible memory 
embedded-pitch-memory-description =
        Dynamic memory allocation is optional. Use a global allocator and dynamic data structures. Or leave out the heap altogether and statically allocate everything.

embedded-pitch-concurrency-alt = Gears
embedded-pitch-concurrency-heading = Fearless concurrency
embedded-pitch-concurrency-description =
        Rust makes it impossible to accidentally share state between threads. Use any concurrency approach you like, and you’ll still get Rust’s strong guarantees.

embedded-pitch-interop-alt = Handshake
embedded-pitch-interop-heading = Interoperability
embedded-pitch-interop-description =
        Integrate Rust into your existing C codebase or leverage an existing SDK to write a Rust application.

embedded-pitch-portability-alt = Luggage trolley
embedded-pitch-portability-heading = Portability
embedded-pitch-portability-description =
        Write a library or driver once, and use it with a variety of systems, ranging from very small microcontrollers to powerful SBCs.

embedded-pitch-community-alt = Shield Logo
embedded-pitch-community-heading = Community driven
embedded-pitch-community-description =
        As part of the Rust open source project, support for embedded systems is driven by a best-in-class open source community, with support from commercial partners.

embedded-learn-more-link = Learn more
