        Over a hundred companies around the world are using Rust in production
        <strong>today</strong> for fast, low resource, cross-platform solutions. Software you know
        and love, such as the Firefox web browser and Dropbox, uses Rust. From startups to large
        corporations, from embedded devices to scalable web services, Rust is a great fit.
